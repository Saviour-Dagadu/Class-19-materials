//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['All Star', 'Drangon Nest', 'Anaconda', 'Escape room']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let newMovie = movies[0]
console.log(newMovie)
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let moviesLenght = movies.length
console.log(moviesLenght)
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
console.log(movies[moviesLenght - 1])
